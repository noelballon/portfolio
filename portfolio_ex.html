  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello there! My name is Noel J. Ballon III. I am a professional front end web developer living in the Phoenix AZ metropolitan area. I moved here from Oakland, CA back in 2005. I just recently finished up a 10 year run at Godaddy.com and now I am looking to better myself and my professional career in web development and design.</p>

  <h1>Where I am from</h1>
  <p>I was born and raised in Oakland, CA. Oakland is the 8th largest city in California and 3rd largest in Northern California.It is a very diverse and eclectic mix of working class families, up and coming artists and musicians as well as a vibrant social and economic scene. Oakland is also home to many artists, actors, innovators and professional sports teams (Raiders, A's and defending NBA Champions Warriors)</p>

    <li>Softball</li>

  <h2>Dream Job</h2>
  <p>It would probably be DJ! I love playing and listening to new music as well as classics and old school jams and having the crowd react positively to everything you play.</p>
  <h2>Reason(s) I am in Web Development</h2>
  <p>Because I love the notion that learning how to code and design something people react to and interact with, can influence anyone from a small one person shop to an whole industry. I like to be on the cutting edge and this field allows one to invest time and effort using the latest technologies.</p>
